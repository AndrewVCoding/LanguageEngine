Parts of a sentence:
	Subject
		simple subject usually contains a noun or pronoun
		can contain modifying words, phrases, or clauses
	Predicate
		action or being
		simple predicate contains the verb
		can also contain modifying words, phrases, or clauses
	Direct Object
		receives the action of the sentence
		usually a noun or pronoun
	Indirect Object
		to whom or for whom the action is being done
		usually a common noun or pronoun
	Subject Complement
		renames or describes the subject
		usually a noun, pronoun, or adjective
		occur when there is a linking verb within the sentence


Sentence Fragment
	missing subject
	missing verb
	unfinished thought
	Certain words automatically make a clause incomplete:
		since, while, when, unless, although
		
		
Run-on Sentences and comma splices
	no punctuation or coordinating conjunction between two independent clauses
	comma splice is when only a comma is added between to ICs
	a sentence can be complete with just <Subject> <Predicate>: "I am.", "He runs.", "The chicken walks."
		both the subject and verb can be modified
		the subject can include multiple nouns: "The man and his wife"
	four ways to separate two independent clauses
		1. add a period
		2. a comma and a coordinating conjunction
		3. a semicolon
		4. add a subordinating conjunction between the clauses
	An Independent Clause contains one subject/predicate pair and expresses a complete thought
	A simple sentence is made up of only one IC
	A run on sentence is made up of two or more ICs not joined correctly
	A comma splice is an incorrect use of a comma to join two ICs
	A compound sentence contains two or more ICs correctly joined by a semicolon or a comma and coordinating conjunction
	A complex sentence contains one IC and one or more DCs. The DC begins with a subordinating conjunction


Types:
	Simple
		One independent clause
	Compound
		Two independent clauses
	Complex
		One independent clause and one dependent clause
	Compound/Complex
		at least two independent clauses and at least one dependent clause
		
		
Purpose:
	Declarative		make statements
	Interrogative	ask questions
	Imperative		give commands, make demands or requests
	Exclamatory		convey strong emotions and end in exclamation points
	
Clauses:
	Independent
	Dependent
	
	Joining Clauses:
		Coordinating independent clauses
			Method 1A: semicolon
				IC ; IC
			Method 1B: semicolon with conjunctive adverb and comma
				IC ; {moreover, however, consequently, indeed, nevertheless, therefore} IC
			Method 2: comma and coordinating conjunction
				IC , {for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so} IC
		Subordinating Dependent Clauses
			Method 1: IC first
				IC DC
			Method 2: DC first
				DC , IC
		Turning an IC into a DC
			Use a Subordinating Conjunction
				after, although, as (as if), because, before, even though, if,
				in order that, rather than, since, so that, than, that, though,
				unless, until, when, whenever, whereas, whether, while
	
Subject-verb agreement
	Number
	Person
	
	3rd Singular
		usually add an s to the end of a verb
		sits, is sitting, was sitting, has sat, has been sitting, does not sit, doesn't sit
	3rd Plural
		sit, are sitting, were sitting, have sat, have been sitting, do not sit, don't sit
		
	Compound subjects
		joined by 'and'
			treated as plural
		joined by 'or' or '<n> either <n> or'
			agrees with the subject nearer to the verb
	
	Relative clauses
		begin with relative pronouns
			who, that, or which
		contain a verb separate from that of the IC
		The verb agrees in person and number to the word to which the relative pronoun refers
		'Most instructors appreciate students who ask good questions.'
	
	Verb preceding the subject
		In questions, subject follows verb but subject still determines the person and number of the verb
		'Where in the forest are the foxes'
		Same case in sentences that begin in a construction, 'here is' or 'there are'
		
	Indefinite Pronoun Subjects
		some indefinite pronouns are always singular and some are always plural
			always singular require 3rd person singular verb:
				nobody knows, has anyone asked, everyone says, each gets, one uses, another has arrived
			always plural requires a plural verb form:
				several work, many have done, few believe, both were
				
				
Verb tense
	simple present, past, future
		place actions in time
	perfect tenses (have, has, had)
		express events/actions completed
	progressive tenses(-ing verbs and helpers such as is, was, were)
		events/actions that are ongoing
	
	Intentional shifting to convey order of occurrence
		generalities and truisms are always expressed in simple present tense
		
		
Other Phrases
	Verbal
		Gerunds (-ing forms that function as nouns)
			Gerund phrases are nouns
		Participles (present or past participle verb forms that function as adjectives)
			Participial phrases are adjectives
		Infinitives (the root form of a verb preceded by 'to')
			Infinitive phrase functions as a noun, adjective, or adverb
		Appositive phrases are nouns
			an appositive is a noun phrase that renames or restates the preceding noun or pronoun
			usually contained parenthetically by commas unless necessary, such as a single word
		Absolute Phrases
			modify the entire sentence
			typically consists of a <noun/pronoun> and a <participle>
			
			
Pronoun Reference
	Must match person, number, and case of words they replace
		1st person: I, me, we, us
		2nd person: you
		3rd person: he, him, she, her, it, they, them
	Must also agree in person and number with Antecedent
	Gender neutral pronouns
	Unambiguous reference
		referent must appear prior to the pronoun that refers to it
			may appear in a nearby sentence if reference is clear enough

			
Relative Pronouns
	1. Relative pronouns introduce subordinate clauses functioning as adjectives
		The man 'who was running' escaped more easily.
			'who' points back to The man
	2.  Use commas to set off nonrestrictive elements but not restrictive elements
		restrictive element: defines or limits the meaning of the word it modifies
			"... pants that are blue"
		nonrestrictive: "... pants, which are blue"
	3. choice of [that, which, who, whom] is dependent upon the way in which the pronoun is used
	   as well as the noun or pronoun to which it refers.
		generally: 'that' for restrictive clauses
				   'which' for nonrestrictive clauses
		do not use 'which' to refer to persons, instead use 'who'
		but 'that' can refer to a group
	4. 'who', 'which', and 'that' take verbs that agree with their antecedents
	
	
Avoiding Modifier Problems
	1. Simple adjectives precede the target
	2. Adjective phrases and clauses follow the target
	3. Adverbs move around
		'squinting' adverbs seem to be modifying multiple things at once
	4. Limiters precede
		only, almost, just, nearly, hardly
	Dangling modifiers
